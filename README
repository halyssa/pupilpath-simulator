All data used in this program should originate from your pupilpath. Its purpose is to find the grade you need on your next assignment(s) in order to reach a desired grade that you input. The desired grade could be for either a course average or a specific category within a course. Keep in mind that all inputs are case sensitive (ex. CoURSe does not work in place of course). Happy calculating!!!
